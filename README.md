# Team N.I.C.K. 
-----------
pitch notes:

we call walmart api to get data - fresh data
- if we had more than just 10 hours, we would save this stuff to mongodb and be able to play with trends

we list the ten items in it's own product card
- their name
- their price
- the picture 
- description 
- customer rating


users can sort by a few categories and web app will show accordingly
theoretically we could track click counts on products and with that knowledge, opt to show it higher on the


we also have this feature where enlisted users in this alerting program - when prices drop below msrp
would get a text whenever a product in a category (such as electronics) price drops below msrp

for example, here's two texts of two products that are selling below msrp
- user can register for certain category 
- every time product in that catergory drops below msrp
- text users registered to that "[product] is selling below msrp at $[price]"
- we could additionally send users a picture of the product and it's rating info it it is > 4 stars 
- also could send a bit.ly for a link to the product directly
that could help promote sales
