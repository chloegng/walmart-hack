pitch notes

we call walmart api to get data - fresh data
if we had more than just 10 hours, we would save this stuff to mongodb and be able to play with trends


we also have this feature where enlisted users in this program 
would get a text whenever a product in a category (such as electronics) price drops below msrp

for example, here's two texts of two products that are selling below msrp
- user can register for certain category 
- every time product in that catergory drops below msrp
- text users registered to that "[product] is selling below msrp at $[price]"
